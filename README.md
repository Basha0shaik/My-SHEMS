Smart Home Energy Management System

Problem Statement

Energy consumption in residential areas is often inefficient, leading to higher utility bills and environmental impact. Homeowners lack effective tools to monitor and optimize their energy usage. There is a need for an intelligent system that can manage and reduce energy consumption in homes.

Proposed System/Solution

Develop a smart home energy management system that uses machine learning to monitor, analyze, and optimize energy usage. The system will control smart appliances, predict energy demand, and suggest energy-saving actions to homeowners.
